libpydhcpserver
===============
*libpydhcpserver* is an open framework for developing DHCP servers in Python.
It is also a project with strong ties (but no forward-coupling) to
`staticDHCPd <http://staticdhcpd.googlecode.com/>`_, and it is very likely that
you are viewing this documentation because you want to do something on the
packet-level from *staticDHCPd*. If so, you're in the right place.

This documentation provides enough information for sysadmins to tweak setups to
their liking and for developers to build new DHCP servers for special
use-cases. The table-of-contents below progresses from basic information to
hardcore internals, so just read until you've found what you need.
