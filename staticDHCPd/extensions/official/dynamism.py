"""
Provides a simple way of defining dynamic allocation pools for more conventional
DHCP behaviour. This module will NOT provide RFC-compliant dynamic management,
but it's close enough to be useful and hasn't yet failed in any use-cases to
which it has been applied.

If you use this module, consider setting `NAK_RENEWALS` in conf.py, to
discourage clients from renewing before their lease-time is up. Alternatively,
leave discourage_renewals=True when setting up a pool to suggest that clients
avoid communicating with the server until their lease is almost up, rather than
at 50% and 75%, which is spec-default.

To use this module, add the following to conf.py's init() function:
    import dynamism
    global _dynamic_pool
    _dynamic_pool = dynamism.DynamicPool(<see its __init__ for parameters>)
    #Add 192.168.250.100-200
    _dynamic_pool.add_ips(['192.168.250.' + str(i) for i in range(100, 201)])
    
    #Expose its allocation table to the web interface
    callbacks.webAddMethod(
     '/yoursite/dynamic-pool/guest/0/leases', _dynamic_pool.show_leases_xhtml,
     hidden=False, module='guest-0', name='show leases',
     display_mode=callbacks.WEB_METHOD_TEMPLATE
    )
    #You could also make it a permanent dashboard fixture:
    #callbacks.webAddDashboard('guest-0', 'leases', _dynamic_pool.show_leases_xhtml)
    #Add 'ordering=N', where N is a bias value, to change its position
    
    #And a CSV form, too, in case any automated processors need the data
    callbacks.webAddMethod(
     '/yoursite/dynamic-pool/guest/0/leases.csv', _dynamic_pool.show_leases_csv,
     hidden=False, module='guest-0', name='get leases (csv)',
     display_mode=callbacks.WEB_METHOD_RAW
    )
    
And then add the following to conf.py's handleUnknownMAC():
    return _dynamic_pool.handle(method, packet, mac, client_ip)
    
    
You can define as many pools as you'd like, but deciding how to use them is
more advanced than what will be covered here. Checking `giaddr` to determine
the relay-source is probably the most sane method, though.

Note that no validation is performed to ensure that the DHCP request was legal,
just that it was well-formed. Malicious clients cannot compromise the server,
but they can trigger DoS behaviour. Given that there's nothing to gain, however,
this is probably a non-issue.

While this module will, if scapy is available, provide sufficient coherency to
run multiple servers in an environment (provided you have decent proxy-ARP
support if using relays), or to run a single unstable server, if you need truly
persistent dynamic allocations, you will need to implement the
functionality yourself (and contribute it, please!), or otherwise set up
another DHCP server, like the ISC's, which is meant for that, and tell
staticDHCPd that it is not authoritative for its network. The intended use-case
for this is giving unknown clients access to a guest subnet so they can be
migrated to a static context. It's usable well beyond that, but it is a
scope-limited design.
