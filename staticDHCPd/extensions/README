staticDHCPd ships with a number of extension-modules in its standard
distribution; these are qualified as either 'contrib' or 'official', depending
on how well-supported they are.

official:
    - guaranteed to work with the release with which they ship
    - receive rapid response to bugfixes and patches
    - will be dropped as gracefully as possible, if deprecated for any reason
    - distributed under the same license as staticDHCPd
    - documented as reference examples
    
contrib:
    - may not be thoroughly tested for new releases of staticDHCPd
    - updated at the maintainer's discretion
    - may differ from the maintainer's version
    - may disappear from future releases without notice
    - may be distributed under any Debian-compliant open license
    - may be entirely free of non-essential documentation
    
common to both:
    - screened for security, to prevent malicious code from being shared
    - well-documented usage information
    - contain contact information for the author or primary maintainer
