staticDHCPd makes use of only GPLv3-compatible resoruces. However, as with
almost any good open source project, some of these resources came from other
places.

This file exists to document the origins of these borrowed resources, in case
anyone might wish to research them on their own.

pydhcplib : http://pydhcplib.tuxfamily.org/pmwiki/
    Mathieu Ignacio's pure-Python implementation of the packet format used in
    the DHCP protocol, plus a simple handler for receiving and sending packets
    via UDP.
    
    staticDHCPd features a completely overhauled, fully updated, and
    stripped-down version of this library, rebranded as 'libpydhcpserver'.
